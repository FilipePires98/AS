# Software Architecture - Course Projects

## Description

This repository contains the work done by the authors on the practical assignments for the course in Software Architecture of the MSc. in Informatics Engineering of the University of Aveiro.
Each project directory contains its own 'README.md' with details on the assignment and instructions on how to run the code.

'Project 1 - Harvest Simulation' contains the first assignment, focused on an architecture where concurrency (processes and threads) are a key aspect.

'Project 2 - Vehicle Supervising' contains the second assignment, focused on a platform based on Apache Kafka that collects and processes information from 
simulated vehicles.

'Project 3 - Scientific Computation Platform' contains the third assignment, focused on a scientific computation platform that relies on four of the most relevant 
quality attributes: performance, availability, scalability and usability.
