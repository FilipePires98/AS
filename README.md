# Software Architecture - Course Project

## Contextualization

This repository contains the work done by the authors on the practical assignment for the course in Software Architecture of the MSc. in Informatics Engineering of the University of Aveiro.
The assignment is focused on an architecture where concurrency (processes and threads) are a key aspect.

The defined technologies to accomplish the goals are: Java for the concurrent application; Java Swing for the UI.
All code is presented with the proper documentation and, by the end of the course, a report on the development and the results will be made available here.

## Description

The project is about a simulation of a harvest in an agricultural farm.
There are two main entities: the Control Center (CC) and the Farm Infrastructure (FI). 
The CC is responsible for supervising the harvest.
The FI is the infrastructure for the agricultural harvest.
The CC and the FI are implemented as two different processes and the communication between them is through sockets.
Each farmer is implemented as a different Thread.
