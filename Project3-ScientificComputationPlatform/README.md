# Project 3 - Scientific Computation Platform

## Contextualization

This directory contains the work done by the authors on the third and final practical assignment for the course in Software Architecture of the MSc. in Informatics Engineering of the University of Aveiro.
The assignment is focused on a platform that accepts and processes computational services requested by the scientific community. 

The defined technologies to accomplish the goals are: Java for the application; TCP/IP sockets for communications; Java Swing for the graphical interfaces.
All code is presented with the proper documentation and a report on the development and the results is available here.

## Description

The project is about a platform for large scale computations for the scientific community.
There are four entities, each held accountable for a set of responsibilities: Client, Server, Load Balancer and Tactic Manager.
Each client and each server runs on independent processes and the Load Balancer and Tactic Manager share the same process.
For further details, read the project's report or contact us.
